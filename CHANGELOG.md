# Changelog

All notable changes to bounded-loops are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-13

Minor release for the verified install, convergence, and agent-integration
experience.

### Added

- A three-lap `convergence-demo` plus a max-iteration trip variant, both
  keyless and covered by ledger assertions.
- Native Codex and Claude Code plugin manifests, a repository Codex
  marketplace, tested installation instructions, and an MCP stdio smoke test.
- A real Codex-backed citation run receipt with a machine-readable ledger and
  redacted transcript excerpt.
- `bl doctor`, `bl runs <loop> --show <run-id>`, and `bl lint --contrib`.
- Clean-room CI across macOS and Ubuntu on Python 3.11–3.13, built from the
  wheel and exercising the README, scaffolding, and MCP server.
- Reproducible terminal GIF and 1280×640 GitHub social-preview assets.

### Changed

- `pytest` is now a core dependency because shipped pytest gates invoke it.
- Codex runner failures now become auditable engine errors, live token usage is
  recorded, and non-Git scratch workspaces use Codex's explicit skip-check flag.
- The citation example now takes two deterministic laps; framework examples
  fail with exact dependency-install guidance.
- README and release metadata now use the canonical count: 68 loop folders, 64
  keyless out of the box. The README puts the verified quick start first and
  uses the real CI badge.
- The npm launcher pins the Python engine to the same version as the npm
  package, preventing silent cross-ecosystem version drift.

### Fixed

- Clean wheel installs can execute shipped pytest gates.
- Runner overrides are shown accurately in the pre-run trust preview.
- Stale CLI output examples and orphaned private-course section references were
  removed.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-08

Patch release for the public install experience.

### Changed
- Clarified PyPI and npm install docs: installed users start with `bl new --list`
  and scaffold a local loop; source checkouts use `bl list` for the full catalog.
- Updated public loop-count wording to distinguish 67 loop folders from the 63
  keyless, zero-setup loops.

### Fixed
- `bl list` outside a source checkout now gives actionable scaffold/clone
  guidance instead of a dead-end `No loops found.` message.
- Clean dev type-checking now passes for the full source and test tree.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-07

Production-hardening release. The engine moves from a runnable reference library
to a harness you can rely on in CI, while keeping the keyless-first defaults.

### Added
- **Composite gates** (`gate.kind: composite`, `mode: all`) — a loop can require
  several independent checks to pass together, with a per-child verdict recorded
  in the ledger.
- **Typed external gates**: `gitleaks`, `semgrep`, `trivy`, `promptfoo`,
  `great_expectations`, and `axe` — adapters that parse structured tool output,
  not just exit codes.
- **`Status.ERROR`** — runner/gate execution failures are now a first-class,
  auditable terminal outcome with a ledger entry, instead of an unstructured exit.
- **`docker` and `worktree` runners** for stronger, opt-in sandbox isolation.
- **Resumable runs** — `bl run <loop> --run-id <id>` persists a workspace and
  per-run ledger (indexed in SQLite); `--resume` continues it; `bl runs <loop>`
  lists prior runs.
- **New CLI commands**: `bl show` (inspect runner/gate/bounds/risk/deps),
  `bl gates` (gate kinds + local availability), `bl audit-loops` (catalog
  copy-paste readiness).
- **Expanded MCP surface**: `bl_show` / `bl_gates` / `bl_audit_loops` / `bl_runs`
  tools, catalog/manifest/prompt resources, and `run_loop` / `write_loop` /
  `audit_loop` prompts.
- **Editor adoption**: VS Code / GitHub Copilot files (`.vscode/mcp.json`,
  `.github/` instructions and prompts) and an `AGENTS.md`.
- **CI** matrix on Python 3.11–3.13, with optional gate/runner end-to-end jobs.
- **`bounds.production.yaml`** for L2/L3 loops, so keyless demos stay approval-free
  while copy-paste production use defaults to requiring human approval.

### Changed
- Loop catalog now spans all seven agentic patterns (`prompt-chaining`, `routing`,
  `parallelization`, `orchestrator-workers`, `evaluator-optimizer`,
  `augmented-llm`, `agents`), reclassified from a single pattern.
- Scratch workspaces are cleaned up after a run by default; `--keep-workspace`
  retains them for debugging.
- Runner timeouts derive from the remaining wall-clock budget.

### Fixed
- Loop integration tests no longer assume a `.venv/bin/bl` path; they invoke the
  package entrypoint directly.
- Optional OpenTelemetry tests skip correctly when only `opentelemetry-api` is
  installed.
- Removed machine-specific absolute paths from example docs; added a lint that
  fails on them.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-06

Initial public release: the bounded-loops engine, the nine bounds + kill switch,
67 runnable loop folders across a dozen industries, MCP server, and agent plugins.
