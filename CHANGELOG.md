# Changelog

All notable changes to bounded-loops are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-07

Production-hardening release. The engine moves from a runnable reference library
to a harness you can rely on in CI, while keeping the keyless-first defaults.

### Added
- **Composite gates** (`gate.kind: composite`, `mode: all`) — a loop can require
  several independent checks to pass together, with a per-child verdict recorded
  in the ledger.
- **Typed external gates**: `gitleaks`, `semgrep`, `trivy`, `promptfoo`,
  `great_expectations`, and `axe` — adapters that parse structured tool output,
  not just exit codes.
- **`Status.ERROR`** — runner/gate execution failures are now a first-class,
  auditable terminal outcome with a ledger entry, instead of an unstructured exit.
- **`docker` and `worktree` runners** for stronger, opt-in sandbox isolation.
- **Resumable runs** — `bl run <loop> --run-id <id>` persists a workspace and
  per-run ledger (indexed in SQLite); `--resume` continues it; `bl runs <loop>`
  lists prior runs.
- **New CLI commands**: `bl show` (inspect runner/gate/bounds/risk/deps),
  `bl gates` (gate kinds + local availability), `bl audit-loops` (catalog
  copy-paste readiness).
- **Expanded MCP surface**: `bl_show` / `bl_gates` / `bl_audit_loops` / `bl_runs`
  tools, catalog/manifest/prompt resources, and `run_loop` / `write_loop` /
  `audit_loop` prompts.
- **Editor adoption**: VS Code / GitHub Copilot files (`.vscode/mcp.json`,
  `.github/` instructions and prompts) and an `AGENTS.md`.
- **CI** matrix on Python 3.11–3.13, with optional gate/runner end-to-end jobs.
- **`bounds.production.yaml`** for L2/L3 loops, so keyless demos stay approval-free
  while copy-paste production use defaults to requiring human approval.

### Changed
- Loop catalog now spans all seven agentic patterns (`prompt-chaining`, `routing`,
  `parallelization`, `orchestrator-workers`, `evaluator-optimizer`,
  `augmented-llm`, `agents`), reclassified from a single pattern.
- Scratch workspaces are cleaned up after a run by default; `--keep-workspace`
  retains them for debugging.
- Runner timeouts derive from the remaining wall-clock budget.

### Fixed
- Loop integration tests no longer assume a `.venv/bin/bl` path; they invoke the
  package entrypoint directly.
- Optional OpenTelemetry tests skip correctly when only `opentelemetry-api` is
  installed.
- Removed machine-specific absolute paths from example docs; added a lint that
  fails on them.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-06

Initial public release: the bounded-loops engine, the nine bounds + kill switch,
67 runnable loop folders across a dozen industries, MCP server, and agent plugins.
